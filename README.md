# Insta Image Slider
This project was created to be an easy to use instagram image gallery where a user can insert an Instagram user name and receive their instagram images if the profile is public.

It has also been modified to Instaimage-slider-package to be inserted into any project by installing the package, calling a function with a single Instagram user name and the gallery will show up automatically allowing the user/coder to style it as they please.

### Technologies:
- React, via create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
