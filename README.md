# Insta Image Slider
This project was created to be an easy to use instagram image gallery where a user can insert a gallery of their own images after they have requested a token and inserted that into the .env

It has also being modified to insta-image-slider-package to be inserted into any project by installing the package, calling a function with the users token, which should be saved to a .env file for security, and the gallery will show up automatically allowing the user/coder to style it as they please.

### Technologies:
